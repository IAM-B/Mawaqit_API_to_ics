# E2E Testing Status & Progress

**Last Updated:** December 2024  
**Status:** Basic E2E tests implemented, ready for expansion when app is more stable

## ✅ What's Working

### Test Infrastructure
- **Basic E2E tests** are in place and passing (`tests/e2e/planner-basic.spec.js`)
- **Reusable helper functions** created in `tests/e2e/helpers.js`:
  - `waitForCountriesToLoad()` - Wait for country dropdown to populate
  - `waitForMosquesToLoad()` - Wait for mosque dropdown to populate  
  - `fillGlobalPadding()` - Configure padding values
  - `selectCountry()` / `selectMosque()` - Select options by index
  - `waitForElementStable()` - Wait for elements to be visible and stable
  - `navigateToPlanner()` / `navigateToLanding()` - Page navigation with proper waits

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Page loading and form element visibility
- ✅ Padding configuration (input/output validation)
- ✅ Form submission button presence and state
- ✅ Responsive design (desktop/mobile viewports)
- ✅ Basic navigation between pages

### Browser Support
- ✅ **Chromium** - Fully working
- ❌ **Firefox/Webkit** - Missing system dependencies (libicudata.so.66, libwebp.so.6, etc.)

## 🚧 What's Not Done / To Do

### Advanced Test Scenarios
- [ ] Complete user flow: country selection → mosque selection → form submission
- [ ] ICS file generation and download verification
- [ ] Error handling (invalid inputs, network failures, empty selections)
- [ ] Form validation and user feedback
- [ ] Navigation between landing page and planner
- [ ] Accessibility testing (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen readers)

### Infrastructure Improvements
- [ ] Multi-browser support (install missing system libraries)
- [ ] Automatic backend startup in Playwright config
- [ ] Test data management and cleanup
- [ ] Screenshot/video capture on failures
- [ ] Parallel test execution optimization

### Code Cleanup
- [ ] Review and merge/remove old test files (`planner.spec.js`, `planner-simple.spec.js`)
- [ ] Standardize all E2E tests to use the helper functions
- [ ] Add proper test documentation and comments

## 🚀 How to Resume Work

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run basic E2E tests (Chromium only)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/planner-basic.spec.js --project=chromium

# Run all E2E tests (may fail on Firefox/Webkit)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/ --project=chromium

# View test reports
npx playwright show-report
```

### Adding New Tests
1. Use existing helpers from `tests/e2e/helpers.js` for consistency
2. Follow the pattern in `planner-basic.spec.js`
3. Keep tests focused and atomic
4. Use specific selectors (IDs over generic tags)

### Example Test Structure
```javascript
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');
const { navigateToPlanner, waitForElementStable } = require('./helpers');

test('should complete full user flow', async ({ page }) => {
  await navigateToPlanner(page);
  
  // Use helpers for common operations
  await waitForElementStable(page, '#country-select');
  // ... test logic
});
```

## 🔧 Configuration Notes

### Playwright Config
- Timeouts reduced to 30s (from 60s) for faster feedback
- Expect timeouts reduced to 10s (from 15s)
- WebServer config exists but may need adjustment for automatic backend startup

### Helper Functions
- All helpers include proper error handling and timeouts
- Functions are designed to be reusable across different test scenarios
- Timeouts are conservative to handle slow network conditions

## 📋 Priority Order for Future Work

1. **High Priority** (when app is stable):
   - Complete user flow testing (country → mosque → submission)
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Form validation testing

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Multi-browser support
   - Accessibility testing
   - Performance testing

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Advanced scenarios (edge cases, stress testing)
   - Visual regression testing
   - Cross-platform testing

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Firefox/Webkit tests fail due to missing system libraries
- Some tests may be flaky due to network timing
- Backend needs manual startup for E2E tests
- Old test files may have conflicting patterns
